    "## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "🔹 Class Imbalance\n",
    "- 30-day readmissions represent a minority of cases (~11%).\n",
    "- Accuracy alone is misleading.\n",
    "- Recall-sensitive evaluation and threshold optimization are required.\n",
    "  \n",
    "🔹 Age Distribution\n",
    "- The 20–30 age group shows the highest proportional readmission rate (14.2%), but with smaller sample size.\n",
    "- Older age groups (70–90) demonstrate consistently high readmission rates with substantially larger populations.\n",
    "- Operationally, older patients contribute more to total readmission burden.\n",
    "  \n",
    "🔹 Length of Stay\n",
    "- Readmitted patients had slightly longer average stays (4.77 vs 4.35 days).\n",
    "- Statistically significant (p < 0.001), but small effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.14).\n",
    "- Indicates limited standalone predictive strength.\n",
    "  \n",
    "🔹 Clinical Complexity Indicators\n",
    "- Higher number of medications and lab procedures observed among readmitted patients.\n",
    "- Distributions overlap considerably.\n",
    "- Suggests weak but consistent association with clinical complexity.\n",
    "- Reinforces need for multivariate modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### EDA Conclusion\n",
    "- Individual variables demonstrate modest effects.  \n",
    "- This supports the use of nonlinear, multivariate machine learning models to capture interactions and complex relationships."
